+# SIM-ADR-0001: Adopt ECO-0001 conventions and units policy in cpa-sim
+
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Mapped ecosystem ADR:** [ECO-0001](../../../../docs/adr/ECO-0001-conventions-units.md)
+
+## Decision
+Adopt ECO-0001 in `cpa-sim` as the governing policy for naming, units, and coordinate/frame conventions.
+
+## Inherited from ecosystem ADR (verbatim vs summarized)
+Source of truth is ECO-0001; this ADR records local adoption intent.
+
+Inherited policy summary:
+- Use one canonical unit system with explicit unit metadata at interfaces.
+- Enforce unambiguous naming for quantities and coordinate/frame identifiers.
+- Require docs/tests to validate unit expectations and conversions where applicable.
+- Treat ecosystem conventions as normative for inter-repo compatibility.
+
+## Repo-local extension/override
+No repo-local extension at this time.
+
+## Implications for this repo
+- Existing and new `cpa-sim` interfaces should continue exposing units explicitly in schemas and docs.
+- ADR-driven unit and naming checks should be reflected in local tests as they are expanded.
+- Internal docs should reference ECO-0001 rather than redefining conventions locally.
+
+## Migration notes
+- `STATUS.md` should track any remaining unit-normalization TODOs against this adoption record.
+- `docs/roadmaps/v1_to_v3_plan.md` placeholders should reference ECO-0001 through this ADR when work items are concretized.

+# SIM-ADR-0002: Adopt ECO-0002 result schema contract in cpa-sim
+
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Mapped ecosystem ADR:** [ECO-0002](../../../../docs/adr/ECO-0002-result-schema-contract.md)
+
+## Decision
+Adopt ECO-0002 in `cpa-sim` as the baseline contract for emitted result artifacts and harness-facing payload structure.
+
+## Inherited from ecosystem ADR (verbatim vs summarized)
+Source of truth is ECO-0002; this ADR captures adoption for `cpa-sim`.
+
+Inherited policy summary:
+- Emit result payloads that conform to the ecosystem result schema contract.
+- Include required provenance/context fields expected by downstream tooling.
+- Maintain compatibility with ecosystem consumers by preserving contract semantics.
+- Version and evolve schema usage via ecosystem ADR process, not ad hoc local divergence.
+
+## Repo-local extension/override
+No repo-local extension at this time.
+
+## Implications for this repo
+- Any `cpa-sim` result serialization and fixture generation must align with ECO-0002-required fields.
+- Local docs and examples should point to ECO-0002 for schema definitions.
+- Contract-focused tests in `cpa-sim` should be organized to detect schema drift early.
+
+## Migration notes
+- `STATUS.md` should capture remaining placeholder/result-format cleanup work under ECO-0002 adoption.
+- `docs/roadmaps/v1_to_v3_plan.md` should map schema rollout milestones to this ADR rather than duplicating the contract.

+# SIM-ADR-0003: Adopt ECO-0003 validation tiers and CI marker policy in cpa-sim
+
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Mapped ecosystem ADR:** [ECO-0003](../../../../docs/adr/ECO-0003-validation-tiers-ci-policy.md)
+
+## Decision
+Adopt ECO-0003 in `cpa-sim` for validation tier definitions, test marker semantics, and CI gating behavior.
+
+## Inherited from ecosystem ADR (verbatim vs summarized)
+Source of truth is ECO-0003; this is a local adoption record.
+
+Inherited policy summary:
+- Use ecosystem-defined validation tiers to classify test scope and confidence level.
+- Apply standardized CI marker policy for selecting fast/default vs extended validation runs.
+- Keep marker semantics stable so cross-repo automation can rely on consistent behavior.
+- Document and enforce which tiers are required for merge confidence.
+
+## Repo-local extension/override
+No repo-local extension at this time.
+
+## Implications for this repo
+- `cpa-sim` test markers and CI config should align to ecosystem tier names and intent.
+- Local contributor docs should reference ECO-0003 for authoritative marker/tier definitions.
+- Future CI expansions should preserve compatibility with ecosystem validation expectations.
+
+## Migration notes
+- `STATUS.md` should track conversion of any legacy/placeholder marker usage into ECO-0003 tiers.
+- `docs/roadmaps/v1_to_v3_plan.md` should anchor CI hardening milestones to this adoption ADR.

+# SIM-ADR-0004: Adopt ECO-0004 repository boundary and ownership model in cpa-sim
+
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Mapped ecosystem ADR:** [ECO-0004](../../../../docs/adr/ECO-0004-repository-roles-boundaries.md)
+
+## Decision
+Adopt ECO-0004 in `cpa-sim` as the governing statement of repository role, ownership boundaries, and cross-repo integration expectations.
+
+## Inherited from ecosystem ADR (verbatim vs summarized)
+Source of truth is ECO-0004; this ADR records repository-level adoption only.
+
+Inherited policy summary:
+- Respect ecosystem repository boundaries for code ownership and responsibility.
+- Keep shared contracts and cross-repo interfaces aligned with designated owning repos.
+- Route cross-repo changes through documented coordination/publication workflow.
+- Avoid local policy drift on role boundaries without ecosystem-level ADR updates.
+
+## Repo-local extension/override
+No repo-local extension at this time.
+
+## Implications for this repo
+- `cpa-sim` contributions should remain scoped to simulation-domain ownership responsibilities.
+- Cross-repo contract changes initiated here should be coordinated via ecosystem workflows and ADR references.
+- Local docs should acknowledge upstream ownership for shared interfaces and policies.
+
+## Migration notes
+- `STATUS.md` should track cleanup of any placeholder ownership notes to align with ECO-0004 terminology.
+- `docs/roadmaps/v1_to_v3_plan.md` should reference this adoption ADR for repo-boundary assumptions in planning items.
