+**Title:** cpa-sim conventions and units contract for CPA state and stage interfaces.
+
+- **ADR ID:** ADR-0001
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Deciders:** @cpa-sim maintainers
+- **Area:** simulation-core
+- **Related ecosystem ADRs:** ECO-0001, ECO-0002
+- **Tags:** api, data-model, physics, testing
+- **Scope:** cpa-sim
+
+### Context
+`cpa-sim` is the implementation authority for CPA simulation stages spanning laser specification initialization, free-space propagation, fiber propagation, and amplification. To keep these stage boundaries numerically consistent and deterministic, we need one explicit convention set for units, FFT scaling, chirp/dispersion signs, and metric naming that matches ecosystem contracts.
+
+### Decision
+Adopt the ECO-0001 convention set for all internal `cpa-sim` calculations and external contract surfaces:
+
+1. **Internal units:** `fs`, `um`, `rad`; angular frequency in `rad/fs`; speed of light `c = 0.299792458 um/fs`.
+2. **Boundary declaration:** outputs and config-normalized artifacts declare `unit_system: "fs_um_rad"`.
+3. **Metric naming:** dimensional metric keys use explicit suffixes (`_fs`, `_um`, `_rad_per_fs`, `_j`, `_w`).
+4. **Envelope normalization:** the complex envelope is represented in `sqrt(W)` so `|E|^2` is power in `W`; energy integrates as `sum(|E|^2 * dt_fs * 1e-15)`.
+5. **FFT/scaling:** use NumPy FFT sign convention with explicit time-step scaling (`Ew = dt_s * FFT(Et)`, `Et = (1/dt_s) * IFFT(Ew)`).
+6. **Sign conventions:** positive chirp means `dω_inst/dt > 0`; GDD sign follows `d²φ/dω²`; free-space grating equation signs are documented and tested per backend.
+
+### Consequences
+- **Positive:** laser, free-space, fiber, and amp stages can share one stable state contract without hidden conversions.
+- **Negative:** all new metrics and adapters must comply with suffix/unit rules.
+- **Implementation follow-up:** add invariant tests for phase-only energy preservation and sign-convention fixtures for free-space/fiber.
+
+### Validation
+- Unit tests for unit suffix policies and envelope-energy invariants.
+- Integration tests across stretcher → fiber → amp → compressor with deterministic seeds.
+- Physics tests that pin free-space and fiber sign-sensitive metrics.

+**Title:** Canonical `result.json` schema contract for cpa-sim runs.
+
+- **ADR ID:** ADR-0002
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Deciders:** @cpa-sim maintainers
+- **Area:** io-contract
+- **Related ecosystem ADRs:** ECO-0001, ECO-0002
+- **Tags:** api, schema, provenance, testing
+- **Scope:** cpa-sim
+
+### Context
+`cpa-sim` produces outputs consumed by harnesses and testbench workflows. The simulator must emit one predictable result shape regardless of specific stage/backend combinations (laser init, free-space, fiber, amp) so downstream tooling does not require per-backend parsing logic.
+
+### Decision
+Adopt the ECO-0002 canonical result surface for `cpa-sim`, with `schema_version: "cpa.result.v0.1"` and required top-level keys:
+
+- `schema_version`
+- `status` (`ok` or `failed`)
+- `unit_system`
+- `run_id`
+- `timestamp_utc`
+- `config_hash`
+- `provenance`
+- `summary`
+- `metrics`
+- `artifacts`
+- `stages`
+- `error` (required when `status=failed`)
+
+### Artifact and stage policy
+- Large arrays (fields, spectra, temporal traces) are written as file artifacts and referenced by path.
+- `metrics` remains scalar-only for dashboards and optimization loops.
+- Stage records must include stage identity, stage config hash, scalar metrics, and artifact references.
+
+### Failure semantics
+Failed runs must still emit schema-valid `result.json` with actionable `error` metadata and any available partial stage outputs.
+
+### Consequences
+- **Positive:** deterministic ingestion for CI, sweeps, and cross-repo tooling.
+- **Negative:** schema evolution requires explicit governance and compatibility tests.
+- **Implementation follow-up:** add a pydantic/json-schema model and fixture-based compatibility tests.
+
+### Validation
+- Schema model tests for required keys/types.
+- Success and failure fixture validation tests.
+- Adapter ingestion tests that consume only canonical keys.

+**Title:** Validation tiers and CI marker policy for cpa-sim.
+
+- **ADR ID:** ADR-0003
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Deciders:** @cpa-sim maintainers
+- **Area:** testing
+- **Related ecosystem ADRs:** ECO-0003
+- **Tags:** ci, testing, reproducibility
+- **Scope:** cpa-sim
+
+### Context
+`cpa-sim` contains both fast software-correctness checks and slower physics validation for free-space and fiber models. We need explicit marker policy so PR checks stay fast while preserving confidence in theoretical correctness.
+
+### Decision
+Adopt ECO-0003 marker-aligned validation tiers:
+
+- **Tier 0 (PR-gated):** fast deterministic unit/integration checks.
+  - Command: `python -m pytest -q -m "not slow and not physics" --durations=10`
+- **Tier 1 (nightly/manual):** canonical theoretical physics regressions.
+  - Command: `python -m pytest -q -m "physics" --durations=10`
+- **Tier 2 (manual/report):** experimental comparisons with uncertainty accounting.
+
+Required markers: `unit`, `integration`, `physics`, `slow`.
+
+### Tolerance policy
+- Tier 0 uses strict deterministic tolerances.
+- Tier 1 stores metric-specific tolerances near fixture baselines.
+- Tier 2 must document uncertainty sources and comparison methodology.
+
+### Consequences
+- **Positive:** faster PR iteration with explicit deeper validation paths.
+- **Negative:** marker hygiene must be maintained to prevent slow-test leakage into PR gates.
+- **Implementation follow-up:** audit existing tests and add missing markers.
+
+### Validation
+- CI commands map to tier policy.
+- Periodic marker audit in PR review.
+- Determinism checks enforce stable seeded outputs.

+**Title:** cpa-sim stage ownership and domain boundaries for laser, free-space, fiber, and amp.
+
+- **ADR ID:** ADR-0004
+- **Status:** Proposed
+- **Date:** 2026-02-16
+- **Deciders:** @cpa-sim maintainers
+- **Area:** architecture
+- **Related ecosystem ADRs:** ECO-0004
+- **Tags:** ownership, staging, boundaries
+- **Scope:** cpa-sim
+
+### Context
+`cpa-sim` is the implementation owner for CPA-stage domain logic. To avoid cross-repo drift and unclear responsibilities, this repo must explicitly own laser specification handling plus stage implementations for free-space propagation, fiber propagation, and amplification while consuming shared pipeline contracts from upstream orchestration repos.
+
+### Decision
+Within the CPA ecosystem, `cpa-sim` owns:
+
+1. **Laser spec and initialization domain**
+   - Validation/normalization of input laser specs used to construct initial pulse state.
+   - Deterministic initialization (including seeded behaviors where applicable).
+2. **Free-space stage domain**
+   - Stretcher/compressor free-space models and their convention-sign validation.
+3. **Fiber stage domain**
+   - Fiber propagation stage integration (v1 via external solver wrappers, later via in-house backend).
+4. **Amp stage domain**
+   - Amplification stage configuration and gain-model implementations.
+
+`cpa-sim` must not redefine generic pipeline abstractions from `phys-pipeline`; it consumes them and provides domain stage implementations.
+
+### Consequences
+- **Positive:** clear domain authority for CPA physics implementation and ADR-driven change control.
+- **Negative:** broader ownership in one repo increases review burden for cross-stage changes.
+- **Implementation follow-up:** keep ADR references in stage module docs and update STATUS/roadmap when responsibilities evolve.
+
+### Validation
+- Stage-level tests exist for each governed domain: laser init, free-space, fiber, amp.
+- Integration tests cover end-to-end chain behavior and schema-compliant outputs.
+- Boundary reviews reject changes that attempt to shift domain logic to unrelated repos.
